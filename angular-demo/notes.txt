Angular CLI
- Create, build, compile, serve the angular app
- Create any files, components, pipes, services and class

how to install angular CLI

> npm install -g @angular/cli // for latest else specify version // Install cli globally

//Once cli is installed you should run command ng

Create new angular project
> ng new <sampleapp> --skip-install
--Skip-install will not install/get required packages in package.json to local
Command only creates basic angular files

to install package use command
navigate to project folder
> cd sampleapp
> npm install // this command looks for package.json and install required packages from the files
> npm install --no-standalone (will not install node_module but creates angular template)


package.json
//dependencies // ng build
    used to run the application on the server

//devdependencies //ng install
    used to run the application in local

tsconfig.json
This is the typescript config file
few settings like strict mode, target and outdir should be noticied

tsconfig.app.json
//This extends from tsconfig.json
//specify which ts file to compile / start with


tsconfig.spec.json
//This extends from tsconfig.json
//specify which ts file to include for testing


Package-lock.json
this get the dependencies in package.json and its inter-dependencies
It also maintains all the packages with versions and source path
We dont need to touch it


angular.json
has the config when ng serve, ng build and ng test commands are run

//src folder
index.html is the starting file to load it has selector called <app-root>
starting js file is main.ts which has bootstrap code
This pick appcomponent and config file and run the application


app.component.ts has a class and it has decorator
decorator has meta data // also called attribute in c#

//Generate component
> ng g c <component name> //g =generate, c = component


01 - Databinding -- look for folder Databinding
Databinding is a mechanism to bind data values into html DOM and turn user activities into actions
Types
    - Interpolation     component => DOM
    - Property Binding  component => DOM
    - Event Binding     DOM => component
    - Two way Binding   component <=> DOM // Should import FormsModule

02 - Directives
- Extending the power of existing html element
- It changes the appearance & behaviouur of html element
- Types of directive
  Component - Its a directive with a template(html)
  Structural directive - Adding or removing the DOM element  *ngIf, *ngFor (look for component directive-sample)
  Attribute - Change the appearance of DOM element   ngClass, ngSyle, ngModel
  Custom directive
  >ng g d <directiveName> (ElementRef class is key thing to inject in constructor)

03 - NgModule
- Container that contains multiple components, directive, pipe, service, other modules
- NgModule is removed in latest angular version 17

04 - Decorators - Attribute for class
Class Decorators
@component
@directive (look for custom directive appFavs)
@pipe

Method Decorators
@Hostlistener() // Hostlistener is for the method which will listen to the event on the native element
//If you have click event for the button and directive then both will trigger

Field Decorators
@ViewChild

05 - apply css using bootstrap
Install any package in angular
> npm install <packageName> --save

npm install bootstrap --save (save is used to add entry in package.json else it was not shipped out of your machine. packge is installed only in node_modules only)
package.json should have bootstrap reference
refer the bootstrap in angular.json in styles section


06 - pipes
-Pipes are used to transform the bound values (look for pipe-sample component)
-predefined pipes are number, uppercase, lowercase, date, currency, json
Creating custom pipes
>ng g p <pipeName>

07 - Routing
-Loading a webpage based on requested url
-Navigating from one page to other

Steps to implement routing in angular
- Import module "RouterModule"
- Define list of routes
   const routes: Routes = [
  {path:'databinding', component: DatabindingComponent},
  }
- Map the RouterModule with routes
	RouterModule.forRoot(routes)
- Add place holder in app.component.html
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
- Add navlink
    <a class="nav-link" routerLinkActive="highlight" [routerLink]="['databinding']">DataBinding</a>

Read route parameters and routeparams with query string parameters (look for "GoTo Directive" button on pipe component)

-- Child routing / Nested routes call a component inside component with a different child routes


08 - Data sharing (look for customer-add and cutomer-list components)
-@Input() decorater is used to pass data from parent to child component in terms of Property
-@Output() decorator is used to pass data from child to parent in terms of events (EventEmitter)
-Both decorators are created in the child components only
-@Viewchild() This takes the control of the child component and able to set the Property/data //this is used in parent component
Creating a ref of child component in parent & taking control on child component (created in Parent)
This can also be used to access the element

09 - Angular Forms
-Template driven approach
-Model driven approach (Reactive forms)

Angular forms has control states
Pristine state - Form load is pristine also called stable state. One way binding, once goes into dirty never comes back to pristine
Dirty state - if form is touched then it is changed to dirty state
untouched state - is for control when control is loaded, control state is untouched. Once way binding, once changes to touched never comes back to untouched
touched state - when controls is touched then the state is moved to touched from untouched
valid state - when control has validation not applied. 2 way binding, depends on the input and validation the state changes accordingly
invalid state - when control has validation then default is invalid state, once validation is passed then control is in valid state

Pristine => dirty (form)
untouched => touched (control)
valid <=> invalid (contorl)


Steps to implement TemplateDriven approach (add-product component)
- Design a form and add template ref of type "ngForm"
   <form #frm="ngForm"></form>
- Add input elements and provide name & ngModel attribute
  <input type="text" class="form-control" name="productId" [(ngModel)]="product.productId" />
- Add ngSubmit event and pass frm object 
  (ngSubmit)="saveProduct(frm)"
- To add a validation, use html5 attributes
  required, pattern, email, max, min, maxlength, minlength, phone
- To show error message
	 <div *ngIf="frm.controls['productCode']?.errors">
		<span class="text-danger">Product Code is mandatory</span>
	</div>
	
Steps to implement Model Driven approach
- Import a module in app.module.ts "ReactiveFormsModule"
- Design the model in the ts code, using FormGroup & FormBuilder
	this.frm = this.fb.group({
      productId: this.fb.control('')
	  })
- Map the fromGroup & formControl in html template
    <form [formGroup]="frm">
            <div class="form-group">
                <label>Product Id</label>
                <input type="text" class="form-control" formControlName="productId" />
            </div>
	</form>
- Add ngSubmit event & no need to pass formgroup obj
  (ngSubmit)="saveProduct()"
- To add valdiation, add in ts code
  productCode: this.fb.control('',{updateOn:'blur', validators: [Validators.required]})
- To show error message
	 <div *ngIf="frm.controls['productCode']?.errors">
		<span class="text-danger">Product Code is mandatory</span>
	</div>
- Easy to write unit tests 
- Can design complex forms
